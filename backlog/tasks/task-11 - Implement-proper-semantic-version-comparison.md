## Description

The current version sorting logic uses string comparison for pre-release suffixes, which doesn't follow SemVer specification. This can lead to incorrect version ordering when pre-release identifiers contain mixed alphanumeric content.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Version comparison follows SemVer 2.0 specification exactly,Pre-release versions are sorted correctly (alpha < beta < rc),Numeric identifiers in pre-release are compared numerically,Comprehensive test suite validates SemVer compliance with edge cases
<!-- AC:END -->
