## Description

Given the identified race conditions in git operations, comprehensive concurrency testing is needed to validate the thread-safety of bump operations and ensure proper behavior under concurrent usage.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Concurrency tests simulate multiple simultaneous bump operations,Tests validate proper locking and error handling under contention,Race condition detection tools (go test -race) pass all tests,Performance impact of locking is measured and documented
<!-- AC:END -->
