## Description

Current test coverage is 71.3% with missing coverage for error handling paths, edge cases, and integration scenarios. Critical error paths and failure modes need comprehensive test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Test coverage reaches minimum 85% overall,All error handling paths have corresponding test cases,Edge cases (empty repos, malformed tags, network failures) are tested,Integration tests cover end-to-end workflows with mocked dependencies
<!-- AC:END -->
