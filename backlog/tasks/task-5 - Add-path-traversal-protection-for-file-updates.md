## Description

The updateVersionFile function accepts arbitrary file paths without validation, allowing potential path traversal attacks that could modify files outside the repository boundary.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Function validates filePath is within git repository boundaries,Path traversal attempts (../, absolute paths outside repo) are rejected,Symlink attacks are prevented through proper path resolution,Error messages don't reveal internal file system structure
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Enhanced path traversal protection with comprehensive validateFilePath function that includes: 1) Empty/whitespace path validation, 2) Detection of suspicious patterns (../, null bytes, control characters), 3) Absolute path rejection, 4) Symlink attack prevention via filepath.EvalSymlinks, 5) Repository boundary enforcement, 6) Sanitized error messages that don't reveal internal filesystem structure. All path validation is now centralized and thoroughly tested.
