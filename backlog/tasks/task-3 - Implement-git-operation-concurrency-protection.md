## Description

Git operations (createTag and pushTag) lack proper locking mechanisms, creating race conditions when multiple bump processes run simultaneously. This can lead to corrupted tags or failed operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 File-based locking mechanism prevents concurrent git operations,Lock is automatically released on process termination or failure,Operations fail gracefully when unable to acquire lock within timeout,Unit tests verify proper locking behavior under concurrent access
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive concurrency protection for git operations including: 1) File-based locking mechanism with .git/bump.lock files, 2) In-process mutex per repository path, 3) Timeout-based lock acquisition with stale lock detection (5 minute timeout), 4) Automatic cleanup with defer statements, 5) Process information logging in lock files, 6) Graceful degradation with retry logic (30 attempts with 100ms intervals), 7) Updated CreateTag and PushTag to use locking wrappers
