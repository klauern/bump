## Description

Resolve Go version mismatch between go1.24.6 and toolchain go1.25.0 that prevents building, testing, and deploying critical security fixes from tasks 1-3. This upgrade is required to validate and deploy the command injection, git config, and concurrency protection fixes.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Go version upgraded to 1.25.0 in go.mod file
- [x] #2 Build succeeds without version mismatch errors
- [x] #3 All existing tests pass with new Go version
- [x] #4 CLI tool compiles and runs correctly
- [x] #5 Development environment uses consistent Go 1.25.0 toolchain
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Successfully upgraded Go version from 1.24.2 to 1.25.0. Changes made: 1) Updated go.mod to specify go 1.25.0, 2) Cleaned module cache and downloaded Go 1.25.0 toolchain, 3) Removed unused os/exec import from cmd/bump/main.go, 4) Verified build works without toolchain mismatch errors, 5) Confirmed all existing tests pass (13/13 tests passing), 6) Validated CLI functionality works correctly. Note: golangci-lint needs to be updated to work with Go 1.25.0, but core functionality is working.
