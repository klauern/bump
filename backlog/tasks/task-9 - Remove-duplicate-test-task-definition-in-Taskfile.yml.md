## Description

The Taskfile.yml contains duplicate test task definitions at lines 27-31 and 32-36, which can cause confusion and inconsistent behavior when running task commands.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Only one test task definition exists in Taskfile.yml,Task definition includes comprehensive test commands,Task file validates successfully with task --list,No functional changes to test execution behavior
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Removed duplicate test task definition from Taskfile.yml. The test task was defined twice identically on lines 27-31 and 32-36. Kept the first definition and removed the duplicate. Verified task runner still works correctly.
